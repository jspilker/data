![Gas fractions and depletion times](Fig45_fgas_tdep.png)

My first non-SPT paper, that spawned out of a desire to get to use the VLA for
something (anything!), because then I would feel like a "real" radio astronomer.
It turned out to be really interesting! Jodie Foster would be proud.

We subsequently followed up the galaxy we detected here with higher-resolution
VLA observations, published in 
[Spilker et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...883...81S/abstract)

Provided here are the VLA CO(1-0) spectra from Figure 2 in the paper, as well as
the observational results in Table 2.

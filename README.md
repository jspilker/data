Welcome to Justin's clearinghouse!

This is the top-level repository for data, tables, etc. from all my papers over the years. I've tried to be helpful and provide the things I think would be most useful to other people but am happy to provide other materials on request. Each folder here corresponds to a different paper (ordered by publication year) and each contains its own `readme` describing the contents as well as any updated information or caveats.

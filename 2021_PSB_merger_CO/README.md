Spilker et al. (2021/2022), subm.
=======================================

This is a placeholder repository for data related to my submitted post-starburst
merger paper. All the raw data is hosted by observatory archives, but here I will
place things like data cubes made from the combination of multiple ALMA projects.

Expected contents:

* Moment 0/1/2 maps of the CO emission
* The combined CO cube (probably a cutout to keep the file size reasonable)
* The drizzled final HST image
* Extracted CO spectra
* My literature compiled sample data
